# Faster RCNN for Object Recognition

## Overview
Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) is a deep learning-based object detection framework that efficiently detects objects in images. It improves upon its predecessors (R-CNN and Fast R-CNN) by introducing a Region Proposal Network (RPN) for generating region proposals. This integration reduces computation time significantly and enhances detection accuracy.

## Results
The Faster R-CNN implementation provides high accuracy in object detection tasks by leveraging end-to-end training. The use of a Region Proposal Network (RPN) leads to faster and more accurate predictions when compared to earlier methods like R-CNN and Fast R-CNN.

## Features
- **`get_predictions(pred, threshold=0.8, objects=None)`**:
  - Extracts predicted classes, confidence scores, and bounding boxes from the model's output.
  - Filters predictions based on a confidence threshold.
  - Optionally filters predictions to include only specified object categories.
  
- **`draw_bounding_boxes(image, predictions)`**:
  - Draws bounding boxes and labels on the input image based on the model's predictions.
  - Uses OpenCV to render these annotations.

- **Model Training**:
  - Fine-tunes a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model on custom datasets.
  - Uses optimization techniques like Adam or SGD to minimize detection loss.

- **Inference Pipeline**:
  - Processes input images through the trained model, filters predictions, and visualizes results.

## Sprints
1. **Model Setup and Customization**:
   - Pre-trained Faster R-CNN model was fine-tuned on a custom dataset to improve performance for specific object categories.
  
2. **Prediction and Visualization**:
   - Implemented `get_predictions` and `draw_bounding_boxes` to filter predictions and visualize results on input images.

3. **Optimization and Evaluation**:
   - Employed Adam and SGD optimizers to minimize detection loss, evaluated performance on a test set.

4. **Real-time Testing**:
   - Performed real-time testing on video frames or images, demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of Faster R-CNN in detecting objects.

## Conclusion
Faster R-CNN revolutionized object detection by integrating region proposal generation and detection into a unified framework. Its balance between speed and accuracy makes it a preferred choice for many applications like autonomous driving, video surveillance, and image analysis. By leveraging its advancements, developers can implement robust object detection systems suitable for real-world challenges.
